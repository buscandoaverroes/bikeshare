## Destination Parity

##### departure gini histogram
most departures are betwen 0.5 and 0.75 Gini
```{r}
ggplot(sum_station_end, aes(dep_ineq)) +
  geom_histogram() 
```

#### destination gini vs top05p
The Percent of departures that end up in the top 5% of departures stations seem to be farily predictive of the GINI measurement.
```{r}
ggplot(sum_station_end, aes(dep_ineq, departures_pct_top05)) +
  geom_point()
```
