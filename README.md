# Bikeshare

A work-in-progress project to analyze Capital Bikeshare data. The goal is actually to learn R, and maybe do something useful on the side. My research angle looks at any potential changes in aggregate usage patterns due to COVID-19.

Please note that while the code here is available publicly, all system data should be downloaded directly from the capital bikeshare [website](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data), as per their license agreement. The full usage data is quite large (~4gb), so please make the appropriate adjustments or time allotments when running the code.

The code is designed to pull the raw .csv files from folders named by year.
